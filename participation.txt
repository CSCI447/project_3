Particiaption for Project 3
For this project we had one coder, Taylor Heinecke, and then the rest of us each learned the three algorithms thouroughly and had pair programming seesions with Taylor since he know how to fit it all together.  Na'Shea pair programmed GA with Taylor and also coded the preprocessing code for the datasets.  Amy pair programmed DE with Talyor and Scott pair programmed ES with Taylor.  In the screen cast you will see the algorithms being run in the following order on the fertility dataset; Back-prop, GA, ES, DE.  You'll notice the ES test was interrupted by the keyboard due to the fact that it converged early on (look at the errors).  A dataset where ES actually ran to the stopping condition couldn't be used because of time constraints on the length of the screen cast, as these were the larger datasets the produced this behavior.  In the report, you'll find a description of ES having varying behaviors on each of the datasets.
